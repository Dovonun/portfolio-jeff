          I am currently working on my passion project: <br /> - A Visual Novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally this not only includes writing a story but also creating
          characters for it. I draw everything from Visual looks and Reaction
          Variants to designing and writing their Origin, Lore, Abilities and
          place in the World I&rsquo;m creating.
