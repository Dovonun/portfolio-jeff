          Lastly, I would like to mention that my Visual Novel will be hosted on
          a website. Thus my skills also include web design and experience with
          tools like: <br /> - Figma.

          I have been drawing digitally with “Clip studio Paint” for a good span
          of about 3 years now and know the program fairly well. I&rsquo;m also
          familiar with Photoshop though I mostly use my comfort tool for my
          work.

      <Display section={3} />
    </div>

};

export default Section2;
